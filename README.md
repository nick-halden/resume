## Convolutional Neural Networks

In this project I have used CNNs for image classification on the famous (Fashion) MNIST dataset and in an autoencoder framework for image noise reduction on the same dataset.

## Principal Component Analysis

In this project I studied the technique of Principal Component Anaysis on the (Fashion) MNIST dataset. Images get reduced into lower dimensions while preserving as much information about the image as possible.

## Flappy Birds Q-learning

In this project I programmed a light version of the mobile game "Flappy Birds" and used the classic Q-learning Algorithm to teach an AI to play the game perfectly.

## Gaia Online Server Version

This project, which I have programmed together with a friend of mine, is an online multiplayer, server-based, client of a complex boardgame my friends and I love to play.

### About the Game

Gaia Project is a multiplayer Boardgame by Helge Ostertag and Jens Drögemüller which can be played by up to four players.

Each player takes over one of 14 races and colonizes the planets of a galaxy by building various buildings on them. These are upgraded into different types as the game progresses. This allows access to more resources and actions. Six research areas are available to advance the expansion in the galaxy faster and more efficiently than the other players.

The different races with different abilities, changing game and victory point conditions, and a variable playing field offer countless combinations that make Gaia Project exceedingly changeable and permanently exciting.'/home/johann/anaconda3/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

### Installation

Simply run the execytable.

### Usage

#### Starting the Game

To connect whith the other players you have to enter the hosts IP-adress in addition to your name.

#### Modyfying the Setup

Before each game, a setup is randomly chosen. Each player can modify the setup by requesting a new random setup. In case of the setup of the galaxy (the map on which the game is played), one can arrange the placement of the tiles of the map via drag&drop.

#### Choosing your Character

Each player must chose the character/fraction he wants to play by clicking on it's icon. One can hover over their icons to get additional information about them.


#### Building and Upgrading

If it's your turn, u can click on any planet and if all conditions are met, a mine will be placed on it. If you click on a planet with a building of yours on it, it will be upgraded. When there is more than one upgrade possible, you will be asked which one you prefer.
