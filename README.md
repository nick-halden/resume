# Resume
A small resume to supplement the application for the internship in the field of "Semantic Music Technologies" at the Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Digitale Medientechnologie IDMT in Ilmenau.



## Convolutional Neural Networks

In this project I have used CNNs for image classification on the famous (Fashion) MNIST dataset and in an autoencoder framework for image noise reduction on the same dataset.

## Principal Component Analysis

In this project I studied the technique of Principal Component Anaysis on the (Fashion) MNIST dataset. Images get reduced into lower dimensions while preserving as much information about the image as possible.

## Flappy Birds Q-learning

In this project I programmed a light version of the mobile game "Flappy Birds" and used the classic Q-learning Algorithm to teach an AI to play the game perfectly.

## Gaia Online Server Version

This project, which I have programmed together with a friend of mine and which took us over a year to complete, is an online multiplayer, server-based, client of a complex boardgame my friends and I love to play.
